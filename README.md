Ender Dragon Path
Objective
This repository explores mathematical and computational approaches to Minecraft’s procedural world generation and entity pathing. Specifically:

    Village Distribution with Biome Suitability: Simulate a large 20,000 x 20,000 world area (from -10,000 to 10,000 in both X and Z). Divide the world into regions (32x32 chunks, i.e., 512x512 blocks each), and probabilistically assign villages. Each region may contain at most one village based on a biome suitability function. This reduces density to something more realistic.
    Biome Suitability Mapping: Assign biome suitability scores to determine where villages can appear. Use sine/cosine-based noise functions for temperature and humidity fields and threshold them to define Plains, Savanna, Taiga, Snowy Plains, Desert, or unsuitable biomes.
    Stronghold Distribution: Reproduce stronghold rings around the origin with specified radii and counts. Introduce randomness in angles and radii to mimic procedural noise and ensure no two strongholds align perfectly.
    Ender Dragon Pathing in the End: Model the Ender Dragon’s movement as a graph problem. Nodes represent fountain, pillars, and center points. Edges represent possible dragon flight paths. Assign a probability distribution over edges from each node, so the dragon’s next path is chosen by sampling this distribution. This can simulate circling, perching, and strafing behaviors.

Each of these aspects is visualized with matplotlib. The code is modular, allowing modifications of parameters such as village probability, biome threshold conditions, stronghold ring definitions, and dragon path distributions.
Equations and Formalism
Biome Suitability
Define temperature and humidity fields T(x,z)T(x,z) and H(x,z)H(x,z) using multiple frequencies of sine/cosine terms and random perturbations:
T(x,z)=sin⁡(x3000)+0.5cos⁡(z2000)+0.3sin⁡(x+z1000)+0.2cos⁡(x−z1500)+N(0,0.1)
T(x,z)=sin(3000x​)+0.5cos(2000z​)+0.3sin(1000x+z​)+0.2cos(1500x−z​)+N(0,0.1)
H(x,z)=cos⁡(x3500)+0.4sin⁡(z2500)+0.3cos⁡(x+2z1800)+0.2sin⁡(2x−z1200)+N(0,0.1)
H(x,z)=cos(3500x​)+0.4sin(2500z​)+0.3cos(1800x+2z​)+0.2sin(12002x−z​)+N(0,0.1)
Based on T(x,z)T(x,z) and H(x,z)H(x,z), assign suitability ranges:

    Plains if T>0.5T>0.5 and H>0.5H>0.5, suitability [0.9,1.0][0.9,1.0]
    Savanna if T>0.3T>0.3 and H<0.3H<0.3, suitability [0.8,0.9][0.8,0.9]
    Snowy Plains if T<−0.5T<−0.5 and H>0.5H>0.5, suitability [0.6,0.7][0.6,0.7]
    Taiga if T<−0.3T<−0.3 and H<−0.3H<−0.3, suitability [0.7,0.8][0.7,0.8]
    Desert if T>0.7T>0.7 and H<−0.7H<−0.7, suitability [0.5,0.6][0.5,0.6]
    Otherwise, suitability [0,0.1][0,0.1]

This ensures distinct intervals for each biome while maintaining complexity.
Stronghold Distribution
Strongholds appear in known radii rings around the origin: For ring kk, with nknk​ strongholds and radius range (Rmin⁡k,Rmax⁡k)(Rmink​,Rmaxk​):

    Angular positions are evenly spaced:
    θj=2πjnk,j=0,…,nk−1
    θj​=nk​2πj​,j=0,…,nk​−1
    Add randomness:
    θj′=θj+N(0,σθ),rj=U(Rmin⁡k+100,Rmax⁡k−100)
    θj′​=θj​+N(0,σθ​),rj​=U(Rmink​+100,Rmaxk​−100)
    Convert polar to Cartesian:
    xj=rjcos⁡(θj′),yj=rjsin⁡(θj′)
    xj​=rj​cos(θj′​),yj​=rj​sin(θj′​)

Ender Dragon Path Probability
Represent the End dimension’s nodes as VV (fountain center, obsidian pillars, etc.) and edges as E(u,v)E(u,v). Each node uu has edges with probabilities puvpuv​:
∑v:(u,v)∈Epuv=1
v:(u,v)∈E∑​puv​=1
When the dragon is at node uu, it selects the next node vv from this distribution.
Code Functionality
Village Distribution with Biome Suitability
Description:
This function simulates village placement across a massive world region while ensuring villages appear only in suitable biomes. Steps:

    Divide the world into regions of size 512x512 blocks (32x32 chunks).
    Calculate the center of each region.
    Use a probability threshold (e.g., 40%) to determine whether a village spawns in each region.
    Compute biome suitability using noise-based temperature/humidity fields.
    Apply random perturbations to village positions within each region for realism.

Code Snippet:

python
worldCoordinateRange = 10000
regionBlockSize = 512
numberOfRegionsPerAxis = (worldCoordinateRange * 2) // regionBlockSize
villageXPositions = []
villageZPositions = []

for xRegion in range(-numberOfRegionsPerAxis // 2, numberOfRegionsPerAxis // 2):
    for zRegion in range(-numberOfRegionsPerAxis // 2, numberOfRegionsPerAxis // 2):
        regionCenterX = xRegion * regionBlockSize + regionBlockSize // 2
        regionCenterZ = zRegion * regionBlockSize + regionBlockSize // 2
        if np.random.rand() < 0.4: # Probability of spawning a village
            villageXPositions.append(regionCenterX + np.random.uniform(-regionBlockSize // 4, regionBlockSize // 4))
            villageZPositions.append(regionCenterZ + np.random.uniform(-regionBlockSize // 4, regionBlockSize // 4))

biomeSuitabilityArray = np.random.rand(len(villageXPositions))
plt.scatter(villageXPositions, villageZPositions, c=biomeSuitabilityArray, cmap='BuPu', alpha=0.6)
plt.title("Village Distribution")
plt.show()

Output:
Village Distribution
Stronghold Distribution in Rings
Description:
Strongholds generate in concentric rings around the origin with fixed counts per ring. Steps:

    Define radii ranges for each ring.
    Randomize angular positions slightly using Gaussian noise.
    Randomize radial distances within each ring’s bounds.
    Convert polar coordinates to Cartesian for plotting.

Code Snippet:

python
ringDefinitions = [
    {'radius': (1280, 2816), 'count': 3},
    {'radius': (4352, 5888), 'count': 6}
]

for ring in ringDefinitions:
    r_min, r_max = ring['radius']
    count = ring['count']
    angles = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, count) + np.random.normal(0, np.pi/(count*2), count)
    radii = np.random.uniform(r_min+100, r_max-100, count)
    x_positions = radii * np.cos(angles)
    z_positions = radii * np.sin(angles)
    plt.scatter(x_positions, z_positions)

plt.title("Stronghold Distribution")
plt.show()

Output:
Stronghold Distribution
Ender Dragon Pathing Graph
Description:
The Ender Dragon’s movement is modeled as a graph traversal problem with nodes representing positions (fountain center or obsidian pillars). Steps:

    Define nodes as concentric rings around the fountain.
    Add edges between nodes based on observed dragon behavior.
    Assign probabilities to edges for simulating path selection.
    Visualize node distances from the fountain using a gradient color map.

Code Snippet:

python
outerNodeAngles = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 12)
outerNodes = [(100*np.cos(a), 100*np.sin(a)) for a in outerNodeAngles]
centerNode = (0, 0)

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from(outerNodes + [centerNode])
G.add_edges_from([(centerNode, node) for node in outerNodes])

colors = [np.linalg.norm(node) for node in outerNodes]
nx.draw(G,
        pos={n: n for n in G.nodes},
        node_color=colors,
        cmap='winter')
plt.title("Ender Dragon Path")
plt.show()

Output:
Ender Dragon Path
Caveats

    The biome suitability map uses heuristic noise functions rather than Minecraft’s exact Perlin noise implementation.
    The Ender Dragon path probabilities are static; real behavior depends on game states like circling or perching.

Next Steps

    Incorporate Perlin noise for biome transitions.
    Extend dragon path modeling with Markov chains to simulate dynamic behavior.
    Integrate persistent homology techniques for analyzing generated landscapes.
